# Description
For this application I set up a little quiz game for users to play.  Taking the quiz will send users through five multiple choice questions where they can select a certain answer. Each correct answer keeps a score for the user so that at the end they can enter their name.  Once a name is entered, the screen will then go to a highscore page where all games have been logged.
